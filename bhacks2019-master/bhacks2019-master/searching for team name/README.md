Problem Statement :

  1.COW Office automation with the functionalities
    MESS REBATE PORTAL for IIIT-A to speed up REBATE approval process

The Student mess rebate portal was developed in order to simplify the tedious manual process of  request to save time and administration efforts using HTML5 & php web development and MySQL database connectivity as our college server only supports PHP and MYSQL.
The current system for a student to apply for a mess rebate is tedious and time consuming. It includes a lot of undesirable paper work and goes through several hierarchical steps, right from application to approval. In an attempt to avoid this, our team proposed a solution: A web based application for MESS REBATE PORTAL. This application enables individual STUDENTS to apply for a mess rebate.
